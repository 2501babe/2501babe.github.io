<p>\n        but thanks to how crossprogram calling works in solana this can actually be used against you.\n        if you sign for a token account to a malicious program, it can call into the token program and\n        use your signature to approve itself to withdraw an unlimited amount of that token at an arbitrary later date\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        to be clear it could also just steal your tokens then and there.\n        but a program may want to use approvals to a) fly under the radar for some time to massively increase its take,\n        and b) fool phantoms new balance change simulator by not actually changing balances in the transaction you sign.\n        this would be a really cool attack and would scare a lot of people i think\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        this is all because of another interesting (\"interesting\") difference between solana and ethereum.\n        on ethereum, erc20 transfer always uses msg.sender as the token sender.\n        it is not possible for a contract to avoid the twolegged approve and  transferFrom flow.\n        but on solana, theres only transfer, gated by either a wallet signature or an approval.\n        crossprogram calls pass the hash so to speak, and programs cannot distinguish an intermediary from an origin\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        anyway!! this is a client app that pulls your token accounts, checks for active approvals, \n        and creates and sends transactions to revoke them at your pleasure\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        code available <a href=\"https://github.com/2501babe/revoken\">here</a>\n
